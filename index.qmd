# Introduction




## Neon types of reports -- AI summary

In Neon CRM, account-based reports focus on the characteristics and information related to individual or organizational accounts, while transaction-based reports provide a detailed view of financial activities linked to those accounts. Account-based reports use data like contact information, custom fields, and relationships to analyze accounts, whereas transaction reports analyze the financial transactions (e.g., donations, event registrations) associated with those accounts. 

### Account-Based Reports:
Focus: These reports concentrate on the details of individual or organizational accounts within Neon CRM.

Data: They utilize information such as contact details (name, address, email, phone), custom fields (e.g., volunteer interests, giving capacity), and relationships between accounts (e.g., employer-employee, family members).

Examples: Communication & Mailing reports, which analyze account data and custom field information, are a good example. These reports can be used to target specific groups of accounts for communication or analysis.

Use Cases: Understanding constituent demographics, segmenting your audience, and tracking engagement with your organization. 

### Transaction-Based Reports:
Focus: These reports concentrate on the financial activities linked to accounts, such as donations, event registrations, memberships, and store purchases. 

Data: They include details like transaction date, amount, transaction type (e.g., donation, membership), and the associated account. 

Examples: Reports that show the total donations received, a list of event registrants, or the breakdown of membership renewals. 

Use Cases: Tracking revenue, analyzing fundraising campaigns, and understanding how constituents are engaging with your organization through financial transactions. 

### Key Differences:

Data Source: Account-based reports draw data from the account records themselves, while transaction-based reports draw data from the transaction records.

Purpose: Account-based reports are useful for understanding your constituents and their characteristics, while transaction-based reports are useful for understanding the financial activity associated with those constituents.

Interrelation: While distinct, the two report types are closely related. Transactions are always linked to an account, and the information from both report types can be used to gain a more comprehensive understanding of your organization's activities and constituents. 

## Transaction Status Definitions

Transaction is an umbrella term for different types of NeonCRM records, including; donations, memberships, event registrations, and store purchases.

Each transaction record in Neon is assigned a unique ID number (i.e., donation ID, membership enrollment ID, event registration ID, shopping cart ID), which can be seen from the record itself as well as in the Transaction Report.

If the payment was made via credit card or e-check/ACH, then there is also a Transaction ID number, which is generated by your gateway/merchant account when the payment is processed.

### Succeed
The total amount of the transaction has been paid. A successful transaction status triggers the associated System Email (i.e., Donation Appreciation, Event Registration, Membership Registration, Purchase Acknowledgement).

### Declined
A DECLINED status means that the credit card information entered was declined by your gateway provider; and therefore, did not accept the Credit Card payments sent to your Gateway provider. You can see why the credit card was declined by viewing the red error message provided by your gateway vendor. This is displayed under the Payment Information section of the transaction record. You can also see the error message by hovering your mouse over the declined status.

### Pending
A transaction record with a PENDING status means that the total amount of the transaction has not been paid. This status should only appear on a transaction record added by a system user from the back end. This may mean there is a partial payment or no payment at all. A record will remain in pending status until the full amount has been paid, at which point it will change to succeed.

You may come across a Pending transaction that was created by a constituent from one of your front-end forms. This can happen when a constituent:
excessively clicks their browser back button instead of the buttons we provide
clicks the submit button multiple times during credit card entry
tries to submit a form after their session has timed out
In cases like this where the record is missing a payment, it's best practice to reach out to the constituent to see why they had these troubles and collect their payment over the phone if necessary.

Here is the guide to managing your pending and declined transactions.
 
Note: If you have the PayPal Standard payment option enabled, transactions processed with that tender type will always be entered into Neon with a 'Pending' status. It may take a few days for PayPal to communicate back to Neon with the payment information. The Neon record will remain in Pending status until PayPal tells Neon whether or not the payment was successful.

### Deferred

This status is reserved for transactions that are submitted online using the Alternate Payment option.

Deferred transactions cannot be added by a system user.

The Deferred status is also used for wait listed event registrants.

This guide has more details on how to set up and manage Event Wait Lists.

### Cancelled
A system user can manually change a transaction status to CANCELLED. This status is not set automatically, it must be set by a system user.

### Refunded
Note: Refunds can be processed through Neon Pay. Refunds cannot be processed or recorded in Neon CRM through any third party gateway or payment method.
A transaction will have a status of Refunded under any of the following circumstances:

-   If a transaction has only one payment and the payment status is Refunded
-   If a transaction has multiple payments and all payments are Refunded
-   If a transaction has only one payment and the payment status is Dispute Lost
-   If a transaction has multiple payments and all payments have a status of Dispute Lost
